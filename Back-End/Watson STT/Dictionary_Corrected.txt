three three oh one two
and I practice it
and I teach it
wanna show that little video that I keep linked up
it's not by me
it's by somebody else there is a bit ly link up at the top
but if I  just start playing it
an animation
building Linux
nodes to the set of to the set of balls there
we've got sets of files
Linux
just to about here I think
in building Linux
so this is an amazing picture
know many
changing files all over the place
think it's a really really good picture
when software gets built
now open source
a way that stays good
so what is software engineering
well it's not program
cool at
right marvelously linked lists
software engineering is is about people
software engineers
engineering in the same way that a you know
software engineers
how they can construct software
umm
was the first engineer
recent follow this is
engineering been around for hundreds of years
writing software was a kind of an art
that that kind of activity
almost like writing poetry maybe
she's she started to change it
and umm
Buzz Aldrin taken by Neil Armstrong
have landed
around that
and incourage you to go look
essentially if if Margaret Hamilton's 
approach to software
haven't been accepted
they would've crashed
or they would've aborted
first example of how where
uh to deliver
software engineering sometimes has a reputation
um but in this course
and understand the theory
and absorb that
if you want to try to define software engineering
well you can go to wikipedia
and if you went to wikipedia
from these gentlemen
there's a bit ly link again
software engineering body of knowledge
SWEBOK project
have a read of that
again just to think about it
software for the the term software
and that was nineteen sixty nine
so since sixty eight
IEEE was already dilevering transactions
and IEEE transactions
and and the disciplines
here's a reasonable definition
from the SWEBOK work
I think that
that's a little I think that's a typo but there you go
the the last piece
it'll probably be a bit easier to understand
quite a lot of maths and so on
the building in the system
go about finding if there are bugs in the software
testing that kind of activity
really important to scale software development
get away without doing real software engineering
you really have to start thinking
ok so why should you care
article from the by Marc Andreessen
and Marc Andreessen
the techie in that outfit
but uh here and went on
and I guess it's about ten years ago
again link is up there
software reaches
going on about covid
are all built around
that's not possible without proper software engineering discipline
the fact that software becomes
makes it really important that software is built well
there is another reason
kind of like blacksmiths really
only people I can think of who who kinf of do something similar
I want to give you a simple example and I think this is quite interesting
this is a picture of a software engineering tool
softwares eating the world
it is working out
what the developer wants to write
some of the code we write is very unique
somebody using that code would be
straight forward personal reason
how you can use them and if you're going
source control or unit testing
all compiler tracing all the rest of them
part of the toolkit of the software engineer
well the you're not going
some in the class who will never program
systems analysts
capabilities are
how three three oh one two is structured
so this is a recorded session
brought upon us by covid that we have these recorded sessions
more often than that not
live sessions when we can
conversation around some things
module is structured are
technically two lectures
one lecture to do siri
to help scafold it
is a bit unusuall
so we start very small
and are tasks that are focused around
