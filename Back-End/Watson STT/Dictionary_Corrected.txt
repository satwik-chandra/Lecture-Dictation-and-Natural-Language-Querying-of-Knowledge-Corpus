three three oh one two
and I practice it
and I teach it
wanna show that little video that I keep linked up
it's not by me
it's by somebody else there is a bit ly link up at the top
but if I  just start playing it
an animation
building Linux
nodes to the set of to the set of balls there
we've got sets of files
Linux
just to about here I think
in building Linux
so this is an amazing picture
know many
changing files all over the place
think it's a really really good picture
when software gets built
now open source
a way that stays good
so what is software engineering
well it's not program
cool at
right marvelously linked lists
software engineering is is about people
software engineers
engineering in the same way that a you know
software engineers
how they can construct software
umm
was the first engineer
recent follow this is
engineering been around for hundreds of years
writing software was a kind of an art
that that kind of activity
almost like writing poetry maybe
she's she started to change it
and umm
Buzz Aldrin taken by Neil Armstrong
have landed
around that
and incourage you to go look
essentially if if Margaret Hamilton's 
approach to software
haven't been accepted
they would've crashed
or they would've aborted
first example of how where
uh to deliver
software engineering sometimes has a reputation
um but in this course
and understand the theory
and absorb that
if you want to try to define software engineering
well you can go to wikipedia
and if you went to wikipedia
from these gentlemen
there's a bit ly link again
software engineering body of knowledge
SWEBOK project
have a read of that
again just to think about it
software for the the term software
and that was nineteen sixty nine
so since sixty eight
IEEE was already dilevering transactions
and IEEE transactions
and and the disciplines
here's a reasonable definition
from the SWEBOK work
I think that
that's a little I think that's a typo but there you go
the the last piece
it'll probably be a bit easier to understand
quite a lot of maths and so on
the building in the system
go about finding if there are bugs in the software
testing that kind of activity
really important to scale software development
get away without doing real software engineering
you really have to start thinking
ok so why should you care
article from the by Marc Andreessen
and Marc Andreessen
the techie in that outfit
but uh here and went on
and I guess it's about ten years ago
again link is up there
software reaches
going on about covid
are all built around
that's not possible without proper software engineering discipline
the fact that software becomes
makes it really important that software is built well
there is another reason
kind of like blacksmiths really
only people I can think of who who kinf of do something similar
I want to give you a simple example and I think this is quite interesting
this is a picture of a software engineering tool
softwares eating the world
it is working out
what the developer wants to write
some of the code we write is very unique
somebody using that code would be
straight forward personal reason
how you can use them and if you're going
source control or unit testing
all compiler tracing all the rest of them
part of the toolkit of the software engineer
well the you're not going
some in the class who will never program
systems analysts
capabilities are
how three three oh one two is structured
so this is a recorded session
brought upon us by covid that we have these recorded sessions
more often than that not
live sessions when we can
conversation around some things
module is structured are
technically two lectures
one lecture to do siri
to help scafold it
is a bit unusuall
so we start very small
and are tasks that are focused around
possibly more likely Tuesday
obviously the theoretical one and the practical one
practical one this theoretical one is
which is a specific methodology in an agile
agile development
and you know live by and swear by
is a real hard core agile development
there are a series of different
practices and principles
you want to stay clear off for the rest of your life
but enough of me waffling on
sometimes called XP
and you know people would talk about XP
XP development and you know XP tools and so on
invented by this guy
he's the most he's the most important
so this is Kent Beck
and around about nineteen ninety six
Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System
Kent Beck at the time
and the Chrysler people
they thought he could help them
sort out some problems in the in the development
and so he joined them
I spent about three or four years there
so by the nineteen ninety nine
working there with teams
so called C3 system
felt that really software development
he isn't a one trick pony he is
serious guy so nineteen ninety nine
and he called it extreme programming
and this is his book
there are a series of principles
that he felt were important
you know that's important in any methodology
you know apply seven plus or minus two rule can only do so much can only can only
keep up with a certain
from the top right simple design
extreme version of that idea
remember this extreme methodology
as in maybe release two or three times a day
extreme
incremental planning and that the key there
plan forwards too far
and we'll go again from the top right
find someone else has changed it
and you don't get annoyed by that
cause that can only really work
you don't get to be a speacialist in graphics or the user interface design
you have to be kind of like Jack of all trades
is a collective piece
the code ready for the release
that's not allowed in this methodology
everything has to move smoothly
we spoken about that I won't labour it
sort of the increment or the
and each part was built to spec
often people find they don't for various
kind of like the weirdest one
pair programming
but this is genuinely
I'll point you to some videos
genuinely the idea
kind of like police in a police car
who's going to do that with you
not that you are parallel play
to any project manager
you're using two people to do one job
these guys say this is a better way of doing things
go through some of
and I promise we won't go too long on this one
first thing is the iterations
so what does the iteration look like
we know in agile it's going to be
you know iterative it's going to do pieces of work
but in the extreme idea
every two weeks and other methodologies
you don't consider a piece of work finished
correct unless it runs against against
if they haven't committed yet
see if it tests and run before I build it
function or class I'll run the tests
to see if I've broken anything
the compiler think of it that way
okay so that's iterations
the software engineering book
unfortunately their display
the key pieces in the center is the iteration
and if you if you kind of
go from the iteration to tests
could be very rapid computer or could be daily
back to the next iteration
into the iteration
to do with this planning
that that end up being
put into iteration
process by which tasks
are selected into an iteration
let's just tidy up a couple of things
you know the the entry
literally just scraps of paper
there's no documentation going on here
small cards A4 page
just to complete out your
spikes are about
max 2 week piece of research
it finishes after that period
the terminlogy been using
will see literally just scraps
in a moment and that starts to feed
tasks into the iterations
for airing and grab more
the idea here
I'm gonna put up some text
and anything could be chosen
they might be the things that you want to do
they'll work it out
and then fit the time
but keep your iterations solid
need to do task A and task B
the customer who chooses what gets done
pretty strong about that
it's not the engineers there are agile methods
it's kind of like a doctor
and these are some possible treatments
hopefully that gives you a sense of it
top there isn't it
there's no document doing an analysis of this
there's just somebody writes down their stuff
and if all the team understands
you're not going to hand this task
between all all the parties
and there is some kind of organisational structure
the obvious most simple one is
that are to do
kind of structure okay
although the the extreme programming
I don't think
just doing extreme programming and been doing
and scrum are the
sync up of these flavors
a sense of why somebody
why would somebody not want to have documentation at all
and trust this kind
for for building
contacts in the environment would be to
the right one to try these methods
and that's obviously and I showed you this image before
of of all of that
back to this idea again
specification agreed you know
what that actually feels like
there's a planning piece in that
in that process and the planning occurs in three stages
you need iterations
and you know then it'll work
try to chunk those remember
remember the iterative development methodology
how those and
designed artifacts yet
it's kind of literally
and you know x y and z
maybe a bit more detail
so they gather those
how you're gonna chunk those
as kind of
two weekly iterations or sprints
and will do six sprints to get there
that that that release
but anyway you do that kind of iteration level
but you are not documenting
in a proper development iterative methodology
this is almost you might say
part of the team too
part of the team aswell so we'll see if we get there
next piece so once
you know a bag of tasks
move into your iteration planning
then generally call the sprint
that's about
and working out based on that
and the available manpower
that's your sprint plan
there's a good reason for that
all of the iterations
doing an iterative development methodology
that you know iterations
that was supposed to be done in one iteration
the other reason is because that
to this kind of methodology
they are just hints and hunches
into the next iteration should have
I'm gonna plan our iteration
to only find then that
that half the things didn't need to be done
the other half have to be
delayed because other things didn't
suggest strongly you look into bullet journaling
say it again do look into bullet journaling
