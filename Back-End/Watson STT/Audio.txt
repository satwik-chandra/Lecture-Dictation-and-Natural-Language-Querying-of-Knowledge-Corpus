Supported Audio formats for Watson STT
Compression type and audio length per 100 MB are the most important
for our use case. We values the accuracy and processing speed which
we can handle these audio files.

The options for audio formats with a lossless compression are flac
and mp3.
Upon testing conversion using Audacity, 1 hour of lecture material
was ~680 MB as an mp3 and 190 MB as a .flac. For this reason we are
flac files however other formats are easily supported.
