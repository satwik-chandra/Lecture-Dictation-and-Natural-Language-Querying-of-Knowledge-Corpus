possibly more likely Tuesday
obviously the theoretical one and the practical one
practical one this theoretical one is
which is a specific methodology in an agile
agile development
and you know live by and swear by
is a real hard core agile development
there are a series of different
practices and principles
you want to stay clear off for the rest of your life
but enough of me waffling on
sometimes called XP
and you know people would talk about XP
XP development and you know XP tools and so on
invented by this guy
he's the most he's the most important
so this is Kent Beck
and around about nineteen ninety six
Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System
Kent Beck at the time
and the Chrysler people
they thought he could help them
sort out some problems in the in the development
and so he joined them
I spent about three or four years there
so by the nineteen ninety nine
working there with teams
so called C3 system
felt that really software development
he isn't a one trick pony he is
serious guy so nineteen ninety nine
and he called it extreme programming
and this is his book
there are a series of principles
that he felt were important
you know that's important in any methodology
you know apply seven plus or minus two rule can only do so much can only can only
keep up with a certain
from the top right simple design
extreme version of that idea
remember this extreme methodology
as in maybe release two or three times a day
extreme
incremental planning and that the key there
plan forwards too far
and we'll go again from the top right
find someone else has changed it
and you don't get annoyed by that
cause that can only really work
you don't get to be a speacialist in graphics or the user interface design
you have to be kind of like Jack of all trades
is a collective piece
the code ready for the release
that's not allowed in this methodology
everything has to move smoothly
we spoken about that I won't labour it
sort of the increment or the
and each part was built to spec
often people find they don't for various
kind of like the weirdest one
pair programming
but this is genuinely
I'll point you to some videos
genuinely the idea
kind of like police in a police car
who's going to do that with you
not that you are parallel play
to any project manager
you're using two people to do one job
these guys say this is a better way of doing things
go through some of
and I promise we won't go too long on this one
first thing is the iterations
so what does the iteration look like
we know in agile it's going to be
you know iterative it's going to do pieces of work
but in the extreme idea
every two weeks and other methodologies
