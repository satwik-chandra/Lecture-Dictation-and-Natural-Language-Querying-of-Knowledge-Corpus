This is a short enough video
I�m going to work through the series of commits
you should be able to access the GitHub API
what you�re trying to consume
nature of the data
Use that data to do visualisations
I�m showing you my desktop
So we have the Emacs session here
I�ve just listed on a scratch pad
Listed the commits
I have a window here
Set up a Docker based database
Docker based database access
The project is call CSU
Python GitHub
I have a read me
Writing a very simple python script
just a hello world
you�ll need to install python
install a tool called PIP
if you�re a Python programmer and you�re watching
know how to do this stuff in Python
how do we run it?
Let�s just clear the screen
I�m running it on Python three
Python three script dot p y
So that was our first commit
I�m going to check out the next commit
That basically will install PIP for you
Python three get PIP
Make sure you include that in your project
Script up everything that you would otherwise need to do manually
We�re importing something called the pyGitHub library
any documentation
find the documentation for the various things you want to use
I�m just importing GitHub
Need to install the PyGitHub Library
PIP install that
This is an access token
Go to the GitHub developer API
Create yourself a new token
It�s been deleted
in a strict development environment
You should not be putting things like tokens in source control
A token is like a password
Low risk password
Create a github object
Pull back some user details
It provides a function
Get user
A method I should say
A GitHub API call to get the user details
We�re just printing out some of this
a barebones building up an API from scratch
With something like Haskell
Use an existing library
The value of an existing library 
documentation on the library
Documentation on the API
We�re going to expect to get some content
printed out
we can scroll back
running the same script
created any run scripts
from the demonstrator�s account
Web browser
We have the same basic details
T C D 
TCD Dublin
edit the profile
That data
when I run it now
We�re getting a type error
Concatenate a string 
Can�t concatenate a non type
Python equivalent of nothing or null or void
There is no dot location
Dynamic typing
What we set in
The data source
Edit the profile
Obviously get back data
Go back to our scratch pad
Worry about the data type
Library to pull back data
Clean and test the data
We�ll do a git checkout 
three three one two
at my practice
