H. and R. comes the I put nothing nothing magic area %HESITATION so let's go back to the %HESITATION scratch just have a look some was our first commit we started the project a simple hello world I'm at least now we know it's working okay so now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to check out the next just check out the next commit so let's see here we got to something different going on here we now got an extra script their arms we've got %HESITATION the script dot P. H. as before I'm not going to bother \n[04:00]opening in the I'm in the kitchen in the session in the mark session the the get up PIP this is just I remember I told you before any time you need to do something I need your writing stuff into a project that you ultimately commit to a repository somebody's going to need to reinstall PIP potentially again so any time you need to do something just include anything you need it in order to get things going again so this is actually a this is a file that I didn't write and the but that the people who who do PIP wrote and the basically will install PIP for you so you know you would just Hyson three parts and whatever whatever version of pricing a string is using %HESITATION you know get PIP and so on no I'm not going to bother doing it because and I've already done it before would you do that in PIP would be installed but so so as you go along when you when you're going to "
